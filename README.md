Additionally, you are able to select several audio tracks which creates a playlist which is navigable. The audio tracks can be of the type Wave or Mp3. The correlating audio player components are now usable in the main application. Start the audio by pressing "Play". Once the audio starts playing there are several functions at your disposal in order to aid you with the actual transcription. You can: 
#### Pause the audio track (F2) 
#### Timestamp (F3)
This places a timestamp at the current position inside the texteditor which displays the current time of the audio track.
#### Repeat (F4)
This allows you to enter a number of seconds that you want to repeat continuously. To stop repeating, simply press Repeat again.
#### Stop the audio track (which disposes of the currently selected track) (F5)
#### Label
Allows for the creation of a label by selecting a section of text in the texteditor. These are then browsable from the list placed in the bottom right. By selecting a label from the list you can then navigate to the correlating position in the texteditor.
#### Speed rate trackbar
This allows you to set the speed rate of the audio track. This can also be done automatically by checking the checkbox. In this case, the speed rate is adjusted based on your typing speed.
#### Playback trackbar

#### Predefined names list (F6)

For your comfort, there are also available shortcuts for the various functionality which is displayed either in the menu "Audio" or by the respective tooltip for each component. An example being F2 for Play.
Regarding the text editor, there are options to change the font style for the selected text e.g., adding Bold, Italic or even changing the size of the text. The text editor also has an implemented spellchecker for two languages at the moment. English-US is set to default but German is also applicable. This can be changed at run time.
